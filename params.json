{"name":"Photomap","tagline":"A map for photos","body":"### Hi there\r\nThe idea behind PhotoMap is to create easy-to-use maps in order to showcase your travels. When you're telling your friends about your trip to Asia, there's two things they want to know:\r\n\r\n1. Where you went\r\n2. What you saw\r\n\r\nPhotoMap aims to combine those two things into one, meaningful map. Simply click on the places you traveled, and the photos you took from there show up. There is no easier way to visualize a trip.\r\n\r\nPhotoMap was developed with the goal of making it as easy to use as possible, while providing plenty of customization to it so that you can make it your own. There's still a lot of work to go, mainly improving upon it by adding:\r\n- More customization\r\n- Faster loading times\r\n- More web support\r\n- More provided SVG maps\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nNone of this would have been possible without [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
